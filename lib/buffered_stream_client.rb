# This class is wrapper for {Stream::Client} which provides buffering of actions to be executed en
# masse using Stream's bulk APIs.  For example, if a single request makes multiple follow requests,
# we can bundle those up into a single hit to the Stream API and thus make execution more efficient.
# Of course, as with everything else, there's a cost: order of execution is a bit unpredictable, but
# if there's code relying on order of execution with synchronization of data to Stream then it's
# probably bad anyways.
