But with the technology they had in hand, in an attempt to save the civilized race, the people chose to go through with &ldquo;Beast Transformation.&quot; Knowing that other than humans, all animals were safe from the virus, the humans made the decision to inject the genes of animals into themselves to become part-human, part-animal. In the end, the idea was &ldquo;Either you do beast-transformation or die.&rdquo; With the race known as Homo Sapiens gone, by the year 2035, being a beast-human was normal.\r\n\r\nIn this new world, one strange boy, Kokuryuu Kazuto, 14 years old, is the worst runner and least athletic, but somehow also the most popular, with girls giving him hugs and boxed lunches, to his chagrin. But one day, he's approached by three girls, members of a group called the &ldquo;Pure-bred Special Ward,&rdquo; who claim that Kazuto is actually a human, who should not even exist. Although he&rsquo;s in disbelief, he has to accept it as fact when he finds out his &ldquo;ears&rdquo; and &ldquo;tail&rdquo; are all fake.

Then, Kanata resolves going to a room nobody has stepped in for a long time. That room was located in her own ward; “Ward D” and its number was: “The Room No.404″, however, as this room was a mystery to even those patients (monsters) of Ward D and even though what lied inside resulted very attractive to pry into, no one tried doing it before, after all, the Hospital files didn’t even consider an active room anymore.Before she destroys the iron door intruding in her way, a dim, puzzling voice spoke a few words, resembling a warning to her:“Don’t come in. Don’t come in. You cannot withstand my power. If you come in you’ll regret it.”“Cherish life, don’t enter my world.”…this of course was the voice of Mokumoku, a 30 years old NEET who hid an unimaginable power.","total_chapters":0,"hentai":false,"external_links":{},"chapters":[]}
