Even though Midori has an ability to see &quot;unwordly things&quot;, she initially believed that the prophecy was a dream. However, it is later revealed that the true form of the man from the prophecy was Shirogane, the spirit of archery! After some time, Shirogane, who appears before Midori again, requests Midori to become his wife. Gods, who carry the burden of impurities, are revived by the skin of maidens. Midori has an especially strong yet hidden &quot;cleansing&quot; power that could potentially aid the Gods. Although Midori has so far lived a solitary life and has difficulty associating with people directly because of her power, she decides to get married in order to help.

Around the 2000s, around the same time as the Fifth Holy Grail War would have happened, the group that plundered the Grail, Yggdmillennia, openly declares their secession from the Mage's Association and that they are in possession of the Grail. The Association dispatches fifty magi to retrieve it, but all but one are instantly slaughtered by Lancer of Black. The one remaining manages to activate the reserve system of the Greater Grail, allowing for the summoning of fourteen Servants in total.\r\n\r\nThis marks the start of the Great Holy Grail War in Trifas, featuring two different factions, the Black Faction, whose members are part of Yggdramillennia, and the Red Faction, whose members were sent by the Mage's Association with the exception of one from the Church.

By infecting humans with its bite, the monster can create aggressive and undead creatures known as Kabane. On the island Hinomoto, located in the far east, people have built stations to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the station, as well as transport wares between them, with the help of a locomotive running on steam, called Hayajiro. Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and helps to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures. One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikoma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro going out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.","total_chapters":22,"hentai":false,"external_links":{"MangaUpdates":"https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=132200","MyAnimeList":"https://myanimelist.net/manga/97916","Amazon.co.jp":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/u7532u9244u57ceu306eu30abu30d0u30cdu30ea-1-u30b3u30dfu30c3u30afu30d6u30ecu30a4u30c9-u5409u7530u53f2u6717-ebook/dp/B01MZWSOEV"},"chapters":[{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Клык Хороби (3)"},"volume":3,"chapter":21,"upload_date":"7/22/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Клык Хороби (2)"},"volume":3,"chapter":20,"upload_date":"7/22/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Клык Хороби (1)"},"volume":3,"chapter":19,"upload_date":"7/22/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Молчаливые охотники (3)"},"volume":3,"chapter":18,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Молчаливые охотники (2)"},"volume":3,"chapter":17,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Молчаливые Охотники (1)"},"volume":3,"chapter":16,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Мольбы к Небесам"},"volume":3,"chapter":15,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Сгусток Света (2)"},"volume":2,"chapter":14,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Сгусток Света (1)"},"volume":2,"chapter":13,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Неизбежный Мрак (2)"},"volume":2,"chapter":12,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Неизбежный Мрак (1)"},"volume":2,"chapter":11,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Проливающаяся Кровь (3)"},"volume":2,"chapter":10,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Проливающаяся Кровь (2)"},"volume":2,"chapter":9,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Проливающаяся Кровь (1)"},"volume":2,"chapter":8,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Прощальная Молитва"},"volume":2,"chapter":7,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Рассвет не наступит (3)"},"volume":1,"chapter":6,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Рассвет не наступит (2)"},"volume":1,"chapter":5,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Рассвет не наступит (1)"},"volume":1,"chapter":4,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Страх Перед Кабанэ (3)"},"volume":1,"chapter":3,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Страх Перед Кабанэ (2)"},"volume":1,"chapter":2,"upload_date":"7/5/18"},{"alt_titles":{"russian":"Страх перед кабанэ (1)","spanish (es)":"Muerte Espantosa"},"volume":1,"chapter":1,"upload_date":"6/29/18"}]}
